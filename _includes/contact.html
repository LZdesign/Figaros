        	<p class="commission--info">The first step to take to discuss a project is to contact us by phone or email to arrange a first appointment.
         We will discuss your requirements or ideas and weâ€™ll take it from there.
        On the next appointment we will discuss the developing of the design and glass samples.
        Installation can also be arranged. If a new piece is required for a present or a certain date, please keep in mind tha idea development of design andfabrication projects might take a few weeks to complete...with creativity, expertise and professionally.<br/>
        We will arrange a first meeting when we will discuss your idea or the piece that needs to be restored. In case of a new project, a second meeting is recommended to discuss the development of the design and choice of glass. In case of restoration we will arrange a suitable time for the removal of the existing panel and a date for installation once the panel has been restored. <br/>
        If you are interested in an existing piece, if still available, a viewing can be arranged.
        If you are interested in a reproduction of an existing piece, we can arrange a meeting to discuss your preferences in regards of glass and colours or any changes to suit your taste.</p>
